# Homework Assignment 6 - Weather and Vacation Analysis Notebooks

## Description

These notebooks (`PyApi/WeatherPy.ipynb` and `PyApi/VacationPy.ipynb`) use APIs to gather data about locations, and then perform analysis on them.

The `WeatherPy` script does the following:

* Collects cities based on a series of randomly generated coordinates
* Collects weather information about them (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed)
* Analyzes the data for relationships between latitude and other metrics
* Plots the analyses

The `VacationPy` script does the following:

* Collects the list of cities that WeatherPy generated
* Plots these cities on a map
* Finds hotels for certain locations based on criteria I chose
* Plots those hotels on a map

## Notes

Both notebooks are intended to be run from within their respective folder, not from within the root folder.
